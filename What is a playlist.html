          </div>
        </nav>
        <p>A playlist is a list of songs you can make, share, and enjoy listening. Spotify allows you to listen to your own playlists as well as others’ playlists. </p>
        
        <h2 class="mb-4">Types of playlists</h2>
          <p>Personalized playlists (called “Made for You” playlists) are auto-generated by Spotify and based on your listening habits. Spotify remembers what you like, share, save, and skip.</p>
		      <ul>
        		<li>These playlists include your Daily Mix, Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and On Repeat and Repeat Rewind. You can find them in YOUR LIBRARY. </li>

        		<li>Editorial playlists are made by Spotify’s Editorial team, and are based on genre on mood. Find them in Browse.</li>

        		<li>Listener playlists are those that are created by Spotify users. They are extremely customizable.</li>
      		</ul> 

        <h2 class="mb-4">What can you do with playlists?</h2>
         <p>Aside from listening to playlists, users can also collaborate on playlists and share them with others. <br>Learn more about making a collaborative playlist and sharing playlists through the guide. </p>
